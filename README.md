# 🏠 House Rent Prediction

A Data Science project to predict **house rental prices** based on multiple features such as size, city, furnishing status, and more. This project involves **data preprocessing**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and **model building** using **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest Regressor** in Python.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Predict rent prices based on various property features
- Perform exploratory analysis to uncover insights from the dataset
- Train and compare different regression models
- Evaluate model performance using R² Score and RMSE

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Scikit-learn

   - Handling null values  
   - Converting data types  
   - Encoding categorical variables

2. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**  
   - Distribution plots  
   - Box plots & outlier detection  
   - Correlation heatmaps

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   - Linear Regression

## 📁 Dataset

- `house_rent_data.csv`  
  The dataset contains features like:
  - Size (in BHK)
  - Rent (target)
  - Area Type
  - City
  - Furnishing Status
  - Tenant Type
  - Bathroom Count
